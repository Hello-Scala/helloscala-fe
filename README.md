# Introduction of www.helloscala.com
www.helloscala.com is a blog system for sharing web developing skills. Scala is one of languages we are learning and are going to practice in this project.  
Mostly we are more familiar with Java stacks including: Spring boot, MyBatis, spring boot data etc.  
That's why we are using these stacks to build backend server.  
We are also going to sharing our experience of building this blog system on our website continuously.
We are very welcome more geeks to make this platform much more perfect and open.
